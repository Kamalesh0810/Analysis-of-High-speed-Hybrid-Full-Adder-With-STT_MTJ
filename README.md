# Abstract
This paper presents the design and analysis of a high-speed hybrid full adder incorporating Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (STT-MTJs). With the increasing demand for low-power, high-performance circuits in modern computing, STT-MTJs have emerged as a promising non-volatile storage element due to their fast switching capabilities and low power consumption. The proposed hybrid full adder leverages both CMOS and STT-MTJ technologies to achieve an optimal trade-off between speed, power efficiency, and area overhead. The circuit is designed to enhance switching speed while minimizing delay and leakage power, making it suitable for next-generation arithmetic processing units. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in performance metrics compared to conventional CMOS-only adders, highlighting the potential of hybrid architectures in advanced computing systems.
# Introduction
The continuous scaling of CMOS technology faces physical and practical challenges, including increased leakage current, reduced reliability, and higher power consumption. As conventional CMOS circuits reach their limits, hybrid approaches that integrate emerging non-volatile technologies such as Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (STT-MTJs) have gained significant attention. STT-MTJs offer several advantages, including non-volatility, high endurance, and fast switching, making them ideal for energy-efficient digital designs. These properties have paved the way for hybrid arithmetic circuits that enhance speed while minimizing power consumption, making them suitable for future high-performance computing systems.
Full adders play a crucial role in arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and other computational systems. Traditional CMOS-only implementations often face trade-offs between speed, area, and power efficiency, which limits their performance in modern applications. By combining CMOS technology with STT-MTJs, hybrid full adders provide a promising solution to address these challenges, achieving superior speed and reduced leakage power without compromising reliability.
In this work, we present the design and analysis of a high-speed hybrid full adder using Cadence 90nm CMOS technology. The integration of STT-MTJ elements into the CMOS framework not only enhances computational speed but also ensures low static power dissipation, a critical requirement for next-generation arithmetic processors. Simulation and performance evaluations, conducted using Cadence Virtuoso, demonstrate improvements in propagation delay, power consumption, and area overhead compared to conventional CMOS-based full adders. This study provides valuable insights into the design optimization of hybrid circuits, highlighting the potential of CMOS-STT-MTJ architectures to overcome the limitations of purely CMOS-based designs
